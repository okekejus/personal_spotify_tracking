# Personal Music Tracker

This project is a derivative of mainstreamer. I figured it would be interesting to see how my personal music taste changes over time, and also answer some questions I have related to music. 

## Modules 
`streamlit, spotipy, pandas, numpy, pygithub, time, datetime, requests, dotenv`

# How common is my taste in music? 
# What kind of music do I *truly* like? 
# Do hit songs have something that guarantees they will be a hit? 
# Do songs I *truly* like have something that guarantees I will like them? 
# What do my favourite songs look like?
